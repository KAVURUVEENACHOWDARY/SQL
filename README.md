This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, data transformation, and database management. These examples demonstrate how I work with relational databases to extract insights, perform data cleaning, and support decision-making processes.

These SQL scripts are part of my learning, experimentation, and project work as a Data Engineer. They serve as a reference for best practices and practical applications of SQL in real-world scenarios.
